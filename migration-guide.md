# Migration to Version 4
This section contains guidance for migrating from plotly.py version 3 to version 4.

## Online features moved to chart-studio package.
Prior versions of plotly.py contained functionality for creating figures in both "online" and "offline" modes.  In "online" mode figures were uploaded to the Chart Studio cloud (or on-premise) service, whereas in "offline" mode figures were rendered locally.  In version 4, all "online" functionality has been removed from the main `plotly` distribution package and moved to the new `chart-studio` distribution package.

To migrate version 3 "online" functionality, first install the `chart-studio` package using pip...

```
$ pip install chart-studio
``` 

of conda.

```
$ conda install -c plotly chart-studio
```

Then, update your Python import statements to import "online" functionality from the top-level `chart_studio` package, rather than the top-level `plotly` package.  For example. replace

```python
from plotly.plotly import plot, iplot
```

with

```python
from chart_studio.plotly import plot, iplot
```

Similarly, 
`plotly.api` -> `chart_studio.api`
`plotly.dashboard_objs` -> `chart_studio.dashboard_objs`
`plotly.grid_objs` -> `chart_studio.grid_objs`
`plotly.presentation_objs` -> `chart_studio.presentation_objs`
`plotly.widgets` -> `chart_studio.widgets`


## New default theme
A new default theme has been enabled for figures created with plotly.py version 4. You can revert to the version 3 figure appearance by disabling the default theme as follows:

```python
import plotly.io as pio
pio.templates.default = 'none'
```
See https://plot.ly/python-next/renderers for more information on theming in plotly.py version 4

## Add trace return value
In version 3, the `add_trace` graph object figure method returned a reference to the newly created trace. This was also the case for the `add_{trace_type}` methods (e.g. `add_scatter`, `add_bar`, etc.).  In version 4, these methods return a reference to the calling figure.  This change was made to support method chaining of figure operations. For example

```python
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
(make_subplots(rows=1, cols=2)
 .add_scatter(y=[2, 1, 3], row=1, col=1)
 .add_bar(y=[3, 2, 1], row=1, col=2)
 .update_layout(title_text='Figure title')
 .show())
```

Code that relied on the `add_*` methods to return a reference to the newly created trace can be updated as follows.




## Renderers framework
Version 4 introduces a new renderers framework that is a generalization of the `plotly.offline.init_notebook_mode` and `plotly.offline.iplot` functions for displaying figures.  The `plotly.offline.iplot` function is still available and has been reimplemented on top of the renderers framework, so no changes are required when poritng to version 4.  Going forward, we recommend using the renderers framework directly. See https://plot.ly/python-next/renderers for more information.







## Removals

### fileopt argument removal
The `fileopt` argument to `chart_studio.plotly.plot` has been removed, so in-place modifications to previously published figures are no longer supported.




# Migration to Version 3
There are many new and great features in plotly.py 3.0 including deeper Jupyter integration, deeper figure validation, improved performance, and more. This guide contains a summary of the breaking changes that you need to be aware of when migrating code from version 2 to version 3.

For a high level overview, read our [announcement post](https://medium.com/@plotlygraphs/introducing-plotly-py-3-0-0-7bb1333f69c6).

## Simple FigureWidget Example
We now have seamless integration with the Jupyter widget ecosystem. We've introduced a new graph object called `go.FigureWidget` that acts like a regular plotly `go.Figure` that can be directly displayed in the notebook.

Simple Example: Make a Scatter Plot
```python
import plotly
import plotly.graph_objs as go

f = go.FigureWidget()
f  # printing the widget will display it
```

This means that `plotly.offline.iplot` and `plotly.offline.init_notebook_mode()` are no longer required (although still supported).

## Tab Completion
Entering ``f.add_<tab>`` displays add methods for all of the supported trace types. Try it!
```
f.add_
```

Entering `f.add_scatter(<tab>)` displays the names of all of the top-level properties for the scatter trace type

Entering `f.add_scatter(<shift+tab>)` displays the signature pop-up. Expanding this pop-up reveals the method doc string which contains the descriptions of all of the top level properties. Let's finish add a scatter trace to `f`:

```python
f.add_scatter(x=[1,2,3], y=[3,4,2])
f
```

## New Plotly Object Representation
Plotly figures and graph objects have an updated `__repr__` method that displays objects in a pretty printed form that can be copied, pasted, and evaluated to recreate the object.

Eg. `print(f)` returns

```
FigureWidget({
    'data': [{'type': 'scatter', 'uid': '07968b11-7b0a-11e8-ba67-c869cda04ed6', 'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [4, 3, 2]}],
    'layout': {}
})
```

## New add trace methods that handle subplots
The legacy `append_trace` method for adding traces to subplots has been deprecated in favor of the new `add_trace`, `add_traces`, and `add_*` methods.  Each of these new methods accepts optional row/column information that may be used to add traces to subplots for figures initialized by the `plotly.tools.make_subplots` function. 

Let's create a subplot then turn it into a FigureWidget to display in the notebook.

```python
import plotly
import plotly.graph_objs as go
import plotly.tools as tls

import pandas as pd
dataset = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/diabetes.csv')

subplot = tls.make_subplots(2, 2, print_grid=False)
f2 = go.FigureWidget(subplot)

# Use add_trace method with optional row/col parameters
f2.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=dataset['Age'], y=dataset['Pregnancies'], mode='markers'), row=1, col=1)

# Use add_traces with optional rows/cols parameters
f2.add_traces([
    go.Scatter(x=dataset['Age'], y=dataset['BMI'], mode='markers'),
    go.Scatter(x=dataset['Age'], y=dataset['SkinThickness'], mode='markers')],
    rows=[1, 2], cols=[2, 1]
)

# Use add_scatter with optional row/col parameters
f2.add_scatter(x=dataset['Age'], y=dataset['BloodPressure'], mode='markers', row=2, col=2)

f2.layout.title = 'Age and Diabetes Factors'
f2
```

## Breaking Changes

## Graph Objects Superclass
Graph objects are no longer `dict` subclasses, though they still provide many `dict`-like magic methods.

## Graph Objects Hierarchy
All graph objects are now placed in a package hierarchy that matches their position in the object hierarchy. For example, `go.Marker` is now accessible as `go.scatter.Marker` or `go.bar.Marker` or whatever trace it is nested within. By providing unique objects under the parent-trace namespace, we can provide better validation (the properties for a marker object within a scatter trace may be different than the properties of a marker object within a bar trace). Although deprecated, the previous objects are still supported, they just wonâ€™t provide the same level of validation as our new objects.

For example, the following approach to creating a `Marker` object for a `Scatter` trace is now deprecated.
```
import plotly.graph_objs as go
go.Scatter(
    x=[0],
    y=[0],
    marker=go.Marker(
        color='rgb(255,45,15)'
    )
)
```

Instead, use the `Marker` object in the `go.scatter` package.

```
import plotly.graph_objs as go
go.Scatter(
    x=[0],
    y=[0],
    marker=go.scatter.Marker(
        color='rgb(255,45,15)'
    )
)
```

You can still use `dict` as well. The previous figure is equivalent to:

```
import plotly.graph_objs as go
dict(
    type='scatter',
    x=[0],
    y=[0],
    marker=go.scatter.Marker(
        color='rgb(255,45,15)'
    )
)
```

which is also equivalent to
```
import plotly.graph_objs as go
dict(
    type='scatter',
    x=[0],
    y=[0],
    marker=dict(
        color='rgb(255,45,15)'
    )
)
```

### Property Immutability
In order to support the automatic synchronization a `FigureWidget` object and the front-end view in a notebook, it is necessary for the `FigureWidget` to be aware of all changes to its properties. This is accomplished by presenting the individual properties to the user as immutable objects.  For example, the `layout.xaxis.range` property may be assigned using a list, but it will be returned as a tuple. Similarly, object arrays (`Figure.data`, `Layout.images`, `Parcoords.dimensions`, etc.) are now represented as tuples of graph objects, not lists.

### Object Array Classes Deprecated
Since graph object arrays are now represented as tuple of graph objects, the following object array classes are deprecated: `go.Data`, `go.Annotations`, and `go.Frames`. Instead, just use lists.

That is, previously we used:
```
layout = go.Layout(
    annotations=go.Annotations([
        go.layout.Annotations(text='annotation')
    ])
)
```

Now, we should write:
```
layout = go.Layout(
    annotations=[
        go.layout.Annotations(text='annotation')
    ]
)
```

### New Figure.data Assignment
There are new restriction on the assignment of traces to the `data` property of a figure.  The assigned value must be a list or a tuple of a subset of the traces already present in the figure. Assignment to `data` may be used to reorder and remove existing traces, but it may not currently be used to add new traces.  New traces must be added using the `add_trace`, `add_traces`, or `add_*` methods. 

For example, suppose a figure, `fig`, has 3 traces. The following command is valid and it will move the third trace to be the first, the first trace to be the second, and it will remove the second trace.

```
fig.data = [fig.data[2], fig.data[0]]
```

However this is not valid:
```
fig.data = [fig.data[0], go.Scatter(y=[2, 3, 1])]
```

It's not valid because it's introducing a new trace during assignment. This trace would need to be added using `add_trace` instead.

### Data array properties may not be specified as scalars
For example, the following is now invalid:
```
import plotly.graph_objs as go
go.Bar(x=1)
```

This should be replaced by: 
```
import plotly.graph_objs as go
go.Bar(x=[1])
```

### Removal of undocumented methods and properties
 - Several undocumented `Figure` methods have been removed. These include: `.to_string`, `.strip_style`, `.get_data`, `.validate` and `.to_dataframe`.

 - Graph objects no longer support the undocumented `_raise` parameter. They are always validated and always raise an exception on validation failures. It is still possible to pass a dict to `plot`/`iplot` with `validate=False` to bypass validation.
